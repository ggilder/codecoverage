## Example
```yaml
- name: Code Coverage Annotation Line by Line
  uses: ggilder/codecoverage@release/v0.5.1
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
    COVERAGE_FILE_PATH: "./coverage/lcov.info"
```

## Code in Main

> First, you'll need to have a reasonably modern version of `node` handy. This won't work with versions older than 9, for instance.

Install the dependencies
```bash
$ npm install
```

Build the typescript and package it for distribution
```bash
$ npm run build && npm run package
```

Run the tests :heavy_check_mark:
```bash
$ npm test
...
```


## Publish to a distribution branch

Actions are run from GitHub repos so we will checkin the packed dist folder.

Then run [ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc) and push the results:
```bash
$ npm run package
$ git add dist
$ git commit -a -m "prod dependencies"
$ git push origin releases/v1
```

Note: We recommend using the `--license` option for ncc, which will create a license file for all of the production node modules used in your project.

Your action is now published! :rocket:

See the [versioning documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)

## Validate

You can now validate the action by referencing `./` in a workflow in your repo (see [test.yml](.github/workflows/test.yml))

```yaml
uses: ./
with:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
  COVERAGE_FILE_PATH: "./coverage/lcov.info"
```

See the [actions tab](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action/actions) for runs of this action! :rocket:
