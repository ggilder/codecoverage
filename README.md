## Example
```yaml
- name: Code Coverage Annotation Line by Line
  uses: ggilder/codecoverage@release/v0.5.1
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
    COVERAGE_FILE_PATH: "./coverage/lcov.info"
```

## Contributing

> First, you'll need to have a reasonably modern version of `node` handy, ideally 16 or newer. Older versions will change the format of `package-lock.json`.

Install the dependencies:
```bash
$ npm install
```

Run formatting and linting, build the typescript and package it for distribution, and run tests:
```bash
$ npm run all
```

Make sure you commit the `dist/` folder or CI will fail.

## Validate

You can validate the action while developing by referencing `./` in a workflow in your repo (see [test.yml](.github/workflows/test.yml))

```yaml
uses: ./
with:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
  COVERAGE_FILE_PATH: "./coverage/lcov.info"
```
